# ADW Logs Directory

This directory contains log files generated by AI Developer Workflows (ADW). Each workflow execution creates a log file that captures the entire process, including:

- Prompt content
- Model inputs and outputs
- Execution results
- Evaluation feedback
- Iteration history

## Log File Format

Log files follow this naming convention:
```
[workflow_name].log
```

Example: `update-docs_workflow.log`

## Using Logs

Logs are valuable for:

1. **Debugging workflows** - Trace what went wrong when a workflow fails
2. **Reviewing AI reasoning** - Understand how the AI approached a task
3. **Improving prompts** - See how different prompts lead to different results
4. **Auditing changes** - Review what changes were made and why

## Log Maintenance

- Log files can grow large after many executions
- Consider periodically archiving or removing old logs
- Critical logs can be saved to the `tests/results/` directory for documentation

## Examples

To view the most recent log:
```bash
cat config/adw/logs/$(ls -t config/adw/logs | grep .log | head -1)
```

To search logs for a keyword:
```bash
grep -r "keyword" config/adw/logs/
```
