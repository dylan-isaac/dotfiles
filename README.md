### ü§ñ AI Coding Tools

The dotfiles include setup for these AI coding assistants:

1. **[Aider](https://aider.chat/)** - A terminal-based AI pair programming tool
2. **[Goose](https://block.github.io/goose/)** - Block's AI agent for software development
3. **[Repomix](https://repomix.com/)** - Pack your codebase into a single file for LLMs

#### Configuration

- AI tools are installed automatically by the setup script
- Default aliases (`ai-code`, `ai-explain`, `ai-context`) are configured in the main `.zshrc`
- Machine-specific configs (like API keys) are stored in `config/local/.zshrc.local`
- Configuration files are stored in your dotfiles and symlinked to your home directory:
  - `config/local/ai/aider.conf.yml` ‚Üí `~/.aider.conf.yml`
  - `config/local/ai/.env` ‚Üí `~/.env`
  - `config/local/.zshrc.local` ‚Üí `~/.zshrc.local` 
  - `config/ai/repomix.config.json` ‚Üí `~/.config/repomix/repomix.config.json`
- Work vs. personal configurations are supported via the `--work` flag

#### Getting Started with AI Tools

1. **Set up your API keys** in `config/local/.zshrc.local`:
   ```bash
   # For both Aider and Goose
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..." # Optional
   ```

2. **Use the built-in aliases**:
   ```bash
   # Start AI coding assistant with preferred model
   ai-code
   
   # Explain code in a file
   ai-explain path/to/file
   
   # Create a context file from your codebase (copies to clipboard)
   ai-context
   
   # Start Repomix MCP server for AI assistants
   repomix-mcp
   ```

3. **Repomix features**:
   ```bash
   # Basic usage (copy to clipboard, XML format, compressed)
   repomix
   
   # Create instruction template for better AI context
   repomix-init-explain
   
   # Use with instruction file
   repomix-explain
   
   # Process remote repository
   repomix-remote user/repo
   ```

4. **MCP Server**:
   The installation automatically configures Repomix as an MCP server for VS Code (Cline extension) and Claude Desktop if installed. This allows AI assistants to directly interact with your codebase.
   
   - **Automatic Startup**: The MCP server is configured to start automatically when you log in
   - **Manual Control**: If needed, you can control the service with:
     ```bash
     # Start the service
     launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.repomix.mcp.plist
     
     # Stop the service
     launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.repomix.mcp.plist
     
     # Start manually (one-time use)
     repomix-mcp
     ```
   - **Logs**: Server logs are available at `~/.repomix/logs/`

#### Work vs. Personal Configuration

The installation script supports different configurations for work and personal environments:

```bash
# Install with work settings
./install.sh --work

# Edit your config/local/.zshrc.local to set environment
ENVIRONMENT_TYPE="work"  # or "personal"
```

This affects:
- Which AI models are configured as defaults
- Git commit attribution for AI tools
- Available model aliases

## üîê Sensitive Configuration

All machine-specific configuration is stored in the `config/local/` directory, which is excluded from git by `.gitignore`.

The install script will:
1. Create the `config/local/` directory
2. Create machine-specific config files from templates
3. Symlink these files to your home directory

This approach allows you to:
- Keep all your configuration in one place
- Avoid committing sensitive information to git
- Easily update your dotfiles on multiple machines

Key local config files:
- `config/local/.zshrc.local` - Machine-specific zsh settings and API keys
- `config/local/ai/aider.conf.yml` - Aider configuration  
- `config/local/ai/.env` - Aider environment variables

## üìù Manual Steps

Some things still need to be done manually:

1. Generate SSH keys and add to GitHub
2. Sign in to App Store
3. Configure Apple ID
4. Install App Store applications

## üîÑ Updating

To update your dotfiles:

```bash
cd ~/Projects/dotfiles
git pull
./install.sh
```

### üêç Python Environment

The dotfiles configure Python with modern tools for a better development experience:

1. **UV** - A faster, more reliable Python package manager and installer:
   - Replaces `pip` commands with UV alternatives
   - Sets up proper dependency resolution
   - Generates lockfiles for reproducible environments

2. **pyenv** - Manages Python versions

#### Python Features

- **Virtual environments**: Create with `create-venv [name]`
- **Package management**: Use UV commands with aliases like `uvpip`, `uvinstall`, etc.

#### Configuration

UV settings can be customized in your `~/.zshrc.local` file:

```bash
# Example custom UV configuration
export UV_VIRTUALENV_PYTHON="/usr/local/bin/python3.11"
export UV_EXTRA_INDEX_URL="https://my-custom-index/simple/"
```

### üü© Node.js Environment

The dotfiles configure Node.js with enhanced tools for better development:

1. **NVM** - Node Version Manager for switching between Node versions:
   - Lazy-loaded for faster shell startup
   - Automatic version switching using `.nvmrc` files
   - Enhanced `npx` command that respects project Node versions

2. **Project Management**:
   - `create-node-project` - Create a new Node project with proper setup

#### Node.js Features

- **Version Management**: Auto-switching when changing directories with `.nvmrc` files
- **Smart npx**: Uses the project's Node version based on `.nvmrc` or `package.json`
- **Project Initialization**: Quick setup with `create-node-project [name] [version]`

#### Usage Examples

```bash
# Create a new project with the latest LTS Node
create-node-project my-project

# Create a project with a specific Node version
create-node-project my-project 18.19.0

# Use npx with the project's Node version (automatic)
cd my-project
npx some-package
```
