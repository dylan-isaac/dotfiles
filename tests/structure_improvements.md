# Structure Improvements

## Completed Changes

### Configuration File Organization
- Moved Brewfile and its variants to `config/brew/` directory
  - Improved organization by keeping all Brewfiles in a dedicated directory
  - Makes it easier to find and manage package definitions
  - Better aligns with the overall project structure

### Profile Management
- Moved `.current_profile` to `config/` directory
  - Keeps all configuration-related files in the config directory
  - More consistent with the overall configuration management approach
  - Makes backup and restore operations simpler

### Documentation Organization
- Moved `ADW.md` to `contexts/` directory
  - Properly categorizes this file as a context document for AI tools
  - Maintains consistency with other context files
  - Improves discoverability of documentation

### Code Improvements
- Enhanced symlink handling in `bin/generate_config.py`
  - Added `safe_create_symlink` helper function to handle existing files and symlinks
  - Consistent approach to symlink creation across the codebase
  - Better error handling for file operations

## Benefits of Changes

1. **Improved Organization**: Files are now located in directories that match their purpose
2. **Better Discoverability**: Easier to find configuration files and documentation
3. **Consistent Structure**: All similar files are grouped together logically
4. **Enhanced Maintainability**: Future updates will be easier with this cleaner structure
5. **Reduced Root Directory Clutter**: Fewer files in the root directory makes the project easier to navigate

## Future Recommendations

1. **Configuration Templates**: Consider moving template files to an `examples/` or `templates/` directory
2. **Test Organization**: Create subdirectories in `tests/` for different test categories
3. **Documentation Updates**: Periodically review and update documentation to match the evolving structure
4. **Automated Structure Verification**: Add tests that verify the file structure matches the intended organization

These improvements enhance the overall organization and maintainability of the dotfiles system while preserving its functionality.
