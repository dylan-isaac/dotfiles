📝 Prompt:

💻 Executing command: echo "Testing workflow..."
📋 Execution output:
Testing workflow...

🔍 Evaluating results...
❌ Failed: The execution output simply shows a message 'Testing workflow...', but there is no indication that any workflow was actually executed or tested. The requirements specify updating AI tools documentation in the workflow, but there is no evidence that the 'update-ai-tools-docs_workflow' was executed or validated. Additionally, there's no output confirming whether the update to the workflow was successful or what changes were made. To address these issues, the workflow should include specific steps that modify the documentation and provide clear output logs indicating what was changed. Furthermore, the testing command should execute a specific script or function relevant to the workflow update to verify its success.

The execution output simply shows a message 'Testing workflow...', but there is no indication that any workflow was actually executed or tested. The requirements specify updating AI tools documentation in the workflow, but there is no evidence that the 'update-ai-tools-docs_workflow' was executed or validated. Additionally, there's no output confirming whether the update to the workflow was successful or what changes were made. To address these issues, the workflow should include specific steps that modify the documentation and provide clear output logs indicating what was changed. Furthermore, the testing command should execute a specific script or function relevant to the workflow update to verify its success.

## Instructions
Please address the feedback above and make the necessary changes to solve the task.
You have 2 attempts remaining.

Remember to focus on passing the execution command: `echo "Testing workflow..."`

💻 Executing command: echo "Testing workflow..."
📋 Execution output:
Testing workflow...

🔍 Evaluating results...
❌ Failed: The execution output indicates that the command `echo "Testing workflow..."` was executed successfully, but it does not provide sufficient information to determine if the code changes have addressed the task requirements (`update-ai-tools-docs_workflow`). The task requirement suggests that there should be an update to AI tools documentation or relevant workflows, but this is not clear from the provided information. The editable and reference files do not contain an explicit update or addition of documentation related to AI tools workflows under the context or files such as `contexts/ADW.md`. For a successful evaluation, there should be clear evidence that the requirements are met, such as an updated markdown document or a specific change reflecting the update to the AI tools documentation workflow. Furthermore, there is no indication of any errors in the process; however, more detailed output from the workflow execution or logs would be beneficial to confirm the task's completion. Consider reviewing the task requirements and ensuring the necessary updates or documentation are both implemented and verifiable through the output or logs.

🔍 Evaluating results...
❌ Failed: The execution output 'Testing workflow...' does not indicate that the requirement 'update-ai-tools-docs_workflow' was successfully met. While the message generally suggests a testing activity, it provides no evidence of the success or completion of the specific requirement for updating AI tools documentation within the workflow. There are no logs or details showing that the workflow related to updating AI tools documentation was executed or completed. Additionally, there are no error messages, making it unclear if the absence of specific execution results is due to an incomplete or faulty implementation. The process needs validation steps and explicit logs to confirm the workflow is performing the required updates on AI tools documentation as intended. It is also suggested to include verification steps in the workflow that generate comprehensive completion messages or confirmations for each task handled, especially for documentation updates.
